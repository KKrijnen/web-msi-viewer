Browser-based MSI data viewer implemented in Rust and WebAssembly. Supports local visualization and analysis of imzML datasets entirely in the browserâ€”no server-side processing or data upload required.

Currently only .imzml files with the flags <accession="IMS:1000031" name="processed"\> and <accession="MS:1000128" name="profile spectrum"/> are functional.
