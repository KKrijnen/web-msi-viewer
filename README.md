A browser-based Mass Spectrometry Imaging (MSI) viewer, implemented in Rust and WebAssembly. All computations and data handling are performed locally within the browser. Uploaded .imzML and .ibd files never leave the user's computer..

The viewer provides interactive visualization of spectra and images, supports region-of-interest (ROI) selection. The interface is developed using Leptos (Rust/WASM) and Plotly.js for visualization.
